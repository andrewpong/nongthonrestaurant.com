<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
entered the luxurious Wu manor with utter fascination and awe. Never to her
imagination that her family could be so rich. By rich, she meant incredibly two
mansions, ten cars, a hundred and twenty four hotel branches kind of rich. She
was so excited no words could ever be able to describe it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>And
no, she was not caroused by the wealth, but rather by the notion that she was
going to see her father once and for all.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>How
she had been craving for this day since the second she stepped into <st1:place
w:st="on">Hong Kong</st1:place>. True that she hadn't found out anything yet,
but today, she was sure she could. At least, she found out how rich they were.
Not that it made her any more eager.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
walked down the pathway. People would toss her judging eyes. It was no surprise.
Ever since the restaurant incident, rumors had spread around that Gillian was
the slut who torn up the perfect golden couple of Edison Chen and Ruby Lin. She
even heard outrageous versions such as Gillian had turned Ruby lesbo that they
had to do it behind <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s back. All
ridiculous. Not to mention, disgusting.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>She
didn't even want to attend this pool party. Not when the Rich &amp; the Fab
were all here. Daniel and Charlene were the only exceptions from the group that
she could find tolerable and friendly--the rest, they all were blinded by
Ruby's side of the story. Except for that <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
guy, who had hated her from the start. But she couldn't let them think that she
was a coward.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>No,
she was not.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Why
the hell did you suddenly want to host a stupid pool party?&quot; she heard <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s voice from far away. She could also spot
Charlene, Daniel, Takeshi and Kenny; all were enjoying themselves with eating
snacks or sunbathing. But what really caught her attention was the fact that
Ruby was nowhere in sight.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Stupid?
I think it's nice,&quot; Charlene quipped while she enjoyed sunbathing in the
sun in her skimpy pink and yellow bikini that made her look like an Asian
Barbie.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;You
are aware you're not using sunscreen,&quot; Takeshi notified. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;I'm
trying to get a tan.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;And
cancer?&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> snickered.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;You!&quot;
Charlene grabbed a duckie toy she brought from home and tossed it at the crude
guy. &quot;I don't know how you ever get the ladies! You're rude as a
pig!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Ladies
like me the way I am. How else do you think I bunk almost everyone at this
school?&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> boasted proudly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
snorted with disgust. That guy seriously had some pride disease that needed
cure, if there was a cure. He belittled women like they were ants and it
sickened Gillian. One day, she ought to teach that man a little something about
respect.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Gillian!&quot;
Daniel noticed her standing there and waved her over merrily. He was so happy
it made her feel guilty. Sure, she wasn't killing his family, but she felt like
it, being 'undercover' and all. &quot;Hey Dan.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s face contorted with unpleasantness at the sight
of her. &quot;Since when did you two get so close? It's Daniel for you,&quot;
he sneered.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Mind
your business. She can call me whatever she wants,&quot; Daniel tossed Gillian
a benevolent grin as he wrapped his arms around her bare shoulders. The
intimacy almost made her skin crawl with goosebumps. Sure, such closeness
shouldn't be a problem with siblings, but Daniel didn't know they were such;
who knew what could be on his mind?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> watched Daniel with immense horror. &quot;Get your
hands off of her,&quot; he commanded.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Daniel
tossed <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> a weird look. &quot;Why?&quot;
Suddenly, a thought hit him. &quot;Ohhh, you're jealous!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;W-wh-sps-wh--&quot;
<st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> sputtered incredulously, suddenly wanting
to smack that stupid smirk off Daniel's face. But he stopped himself. Why knock
his friend out for a witch? That was such a joke! <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
laughed at himself.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;He's
crazy,&quot; Daniel whispered to Gillian delightfully, as though he was sharing
a top secret with someone special.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
meekly smiled. &quot;Hey, you mind showing me where the bathroom is?&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Sure!
My pleasure!&quot; Daniel grinned and led her into the manor. People watched
them as though every movement of theirs was worth a piece of gold. Gillian felt
uncomfortable. Hell, they were probably degrading her right there with their
outrageous gawks. She could imagine it, hearing it at the university, that
Gillian Chung tried to capture the heart of Daniel Wu, Edison Chen's best
friend.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>When
they reached the destination, Gillian insisted that she knew her way back and
that he should return. He agreed and Gillian let out a relieved sigh. When
there was nobody else in sight, she hurriedly sneaked down the hallway in the
quest for a study room. Usually, that's where incoming mails were kept in
drawers and all, and she was damn determined to fish out an important clue.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Luckily,
it didn't take her long until she stumbled into a magnificent room of wall-shelves
and glorious glass table. Everything looked so high-tech and beautiful she had
to marvel at the whole room for a second before she indulged in searching the
drawers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>God,
she felt like a thief. But this was the only way to find out if her dad ever
got her letter. If he didn't, then that explained why he didn't reply her for a
whole year... but if he did...<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
let out an unwanted gasp as she spot a letter shoved deep in the corner of the
drawer. Heart pounding frighteningly, she uncrumbled it and realized that
indeed, that was her name and address on the envelope in the left corner.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>So...
so he had received her letter. All along, Gillian was hoping he didn't. At
least, that would give her no reason to be angry. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>But
now... She had one.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>That
jerk ignored her for some decades and couldn't even bother to fly over to the
States and attend her mother's funeral? Hell, he didn't even write back to tell
he couldn't, or didn't want to come! All these years while her mom suffered to
bring her up, he enjoyed his life as one of the richest tycoon in HK, never
once asking how they were!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did he really
abandon his wife and daughter like that? In just one second, she could feel the
most powerful resentment ascend to her chest like an unstoppable wave. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Suddenly,
she heard voices. She was quick enough to hide in the corner, covering herself
with the curtains.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Children
these days don't know what's the limit,&quot; she heard a middle-aged man spoke
with tinges of disapproval. &quot;They're all rustling the house upside down! I
should have stayed in the company.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Oh
Jared dear,&quot; a woman spoke. &quot;Don't stress yourself. These kids just
want to have fun!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
peeped from her hiding place and saw them. The man must be her father. And that
lady.... Gillian could feel her hands curled into fists as she remembered the step
mom Daniel briefly mentioned last time. So not only did he live a luxurious
life, he married another woman! So he really had forgotten about her mother!
Gillian had the urge to bolt out and demand some concrete answers from him, but
she restrained. She knew she couldn't do anything irrational or impulsive.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Come
on sweetie; let's get you some fresh air in the garden. The kids aren't
there.&quot; The woman suggested. &quot;Kids never liked gardens.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Both
adults grinned as they dismantled out of the door. Gillian uncovered herself.
She was infuriated.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Not because
of them but more from disappointment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
walked down the hallway. Her heart felt like it had hardened and she felt like
chucking arrows at a target. She had come here with a heart full of excitement
to see her dad, but perhaps, she should haven't been too over exuberated--now,
she felt as if all of her positive energy had been drained and what was left
was a bunch of bitter ones.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Inadvertently,
her fists curled as her mind flashed to the letter she found earlier. The
thirst for some payback suddenly engulfed her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Suddenly,
she felt a hand on her shoulder. Acting on reflex and instincts, Gillian
immediately whirled around and smacked the attacker across his face.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
stared at him. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;What
the fuck were you trying to do?!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
blared deafeningly, tossing Gillian an indignant look. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;What
were you doing behind my back?&quot; Gillian asked. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;I
should ask you. What were you doing wandering around this hallway? The party's
down there!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s suspicion rose as
he approached closer towards her, eyeing her up and down as if to interrogate
her. She must be up to no good. What else could she be doing here? Why, that
witch must be snooping around!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Why
should I answer you?&quot; Gillian rebuked, bearing no intention to play the
role of a criminal being interrogated by a police officer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was getting sick of his skepticism and
tendency to interrogate her wherever she went. It was as if he couldn't go on a
day without trying to pry some sort of gold from her.<o:p></o:p></p>

Stop answering my questions with another question!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
cried. &quot;Tell me, what is your purpose? You were obviously trying to seduce

had taken her as a born devil right from the beginning, accusing her of this
and that, never once faltering on his outrageous observations and assumptions.
No matter what she said, her words were not going to nullify a piece of his
impression on her. Sure back then, she minded it, only because they were
false... But now... she suddenly had an urge to make them true.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;You
know what?&quot; Gillian's eyes suddenly held a threatening glow that
frightened <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>. She walked closer towards
him, making him stumble a few steps backward. Eventually, she nailed him to the
wall. &quot;So what if I am?&quot; She challenged him, her expression an
indescribable acrimony. She was shorter than him by a half foot, but still, the
intimidation she disposed upon <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> was
undeniable. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

exclaimed. &quot;I knew you were up to no good!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
let out a smile. &quot;It took you that long to figure that out?&quot; she
taunted. &quot;Yeah, I'm going to seduce my own brother and pave him his doom.
Then, I'll inherit every dime of his. Oh, isn't that such a perfect plan?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place

sudden burst of pride to know that he had been right about her along, he still
couldn't contain his own skepticism. Sure, he may be a little klutzy, but he
wasn't dumb. &quot;Why do I feel that you're lying?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;I
am?&quot; Gillian let out an innocent question. She neared her face towards his
ear, such that her cheek brushed against his. &quot;Well, you decide.&quot; She
whispered, sending tingling down his spine.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> pushed her off, his heart a thrashing mile of
beats. What the hell was she doing to him? He didn't know whether to believe
her or not. The way her eyes were fluttering whimsically and mysteriously... He
couldn't fathom what shuttered behind those walls. But he knew for one that if
he didn't toss back a combat, he'd lose this battle. &quot;You think you're so
smart? Wait until I tell Daniel about this. Your perfect plan? You can fucking forget
about it!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> spat harshly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Oh
no, I don't think you want to do that, friend...&quot; Gillian let out a
playful grin. She didn't know where this mischievous side of her came from, but
she sure as hell was enjoying his torture. &quot;You know your girlfriend Ruby
who thought you cheated on her with me? Well, what do you think will happen if I
confirm her assumption? You see how she turned into a madwoman at the
restaurant? See what will happen when she actually learns it is true.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> couldn't suppress his outrage. Why, this girl
before him was as cunning as a fox. How dared she corner him like this! He
ought to teach her a lesson, but he knew that her words held a potential
damaging blow. Ruby wasn't quite completely rational. Hell, a small wind could
totally glide her to a side against him. Besides, she had already concluded
that he and Gillian—hell, it would definitely be a mess. Ruby wasn't a very
forgiving girl--once she knew you wronged her, she'd come to no stop to ruin
you. <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> knew his ex girlfriend pretty damn
well.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Oh
try me, Mister Wise.&quot; Gillian cornered him against the wall again, her
bare skin brushing against his bare chest. &quot;Now, I don't think you're dumb
right? Knowing Ruby, she'd make this nation wide news the next day. And not
only will your reputation go down the drain, the police <span class=GramE>might'll</span>
get you too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>That
clever witch! <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s veins boiled as his

of the girl... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
smiled with a tinge of taunt. She didn't like it with someone belittled her.

head over heels with Gillian that he’d believe anything. Not to mention, Daniel
had been acting aversely against <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> for
the girl. Charlene on the other hand even dared to abandon the Rich &amp; <span

<st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> stared in total defeat at the terribly

sauntering through her body. “And you want evidence? Here’s evidence.” She
locked her arms around his neck seductively, her eyes sprinkling with
manipulation. However, a couple walked pass, accidentally bumping into Gillian.
The unexpected force propelled her forward, farther than what she had wanted.
The end result?<o:p></o:p></p>

close out of her desires! Now he must think that she was a low born slut trying
to tempt him under her power, which was something utterly too degrading for
Gillian to stomach.<o:p></o:p></p>
