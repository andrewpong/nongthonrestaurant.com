margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

think that this university had gained its name of elitism and classiness. The
scene before them contradict every modicum of the golden title. It was six in
the evening and who the hell wanted to spend the rest of their evening in this
trashy place, cleaning up? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;

margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

&quot;If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't end up this way!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Come on, we all have a fault in this...&quot; Daniel tried to
defend Gillian, but Ruby would hear none of it. She was far too blinded by her
hate for this girl that any other feeling was impossible to bear. &quot;Let's
start okay? Why don't Tackie clean the tables. Gillian, you can sweep the
floor. Edison, you take out the garbage. Ruby; you can wash the dishes. I'll
wipe the stuff in the kitchen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

have any other ideas?&quot;</p>

margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

night,&quot; Edison growled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

asked sweetly, trotting over to his side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Uh, I'd rather not,&quot; he replied bluntly, making her pout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Gillian had always started working. Everyone was just too busy yapping at
each other that they hadn't noticed. &quot;See, look at Gillian. You guys
should all be like her,&quot; Daniel commended her diligence and no-nonsense
attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Ruby rolled her eyes, thinking Gillian did that just to capture people's
hearts. &quot;What a rude bitch,&quot; she said loudly so as to make Gillian
hear her perfectly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Gillian had half the urge to swing her broom at the obnoxious girl but
she restrained her demonic side. Ruby didn't worth her time. And she didn't
want to cause any more unnecessary trouble than she already did. After all, she
was the culprit to the whole mess and Gillian felt guilty that she had pulled
the whole crowd down with her. If only she had just accepted that stupid F. But
then, that would never happen given the scope of her pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Look, let's just put it this way. If you guys don't wanna work,
just leave it to me,&quot; Gillian said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Oh come on, why would we do that?&quot; Takeshi asked, grinning.
Gillian found his transformation a bit hard to believe. Just a few days ago, he
didn't even give a damn about her. But now, the respect he bore was almost
miraculous. &quot;We're in this together.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Please, she's just playing cunning. She offered to do your dirty
work today; the next morning, she'd head straight to the headmaster to tattle
tale on you. I know those tricks pretty damn well,&quot; Ruby cynically said.
For a moment, she appeared highly intellectual, an image that rarely ever
associated with Ruby Lin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Talking about yourself?&quot; Edison asked mockingly, offending
Ruby who always took his comments to heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Stop talking. Why don't you guys ever give it a rest?&quot; Daniel
asked, annoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Oh, don't command me what to do!&quot; Ruby rebuked, anger
ascending. &quot;It isn't my fault we got into this. If there's anyone to
blame, it's that troublemaker. Sheesh, why am I always blamed for
everything?&quot; Ruby glanced around when nobody replied to her remark, only
to find that they had already started working. Fuming with indignation that she
was rudely ignored by everyone, Ruby stomped off to the kitchen and attend her
task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Gillian was sweeping the floor when she suddenly heard clashes of dishes
shattered into pieces. Shocked by the loud noises, everyone perked their heads
up to see what was going on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;This is stupid!&quot; Ruby complained, hating the fact that she had
to carry piles of dishes to the dish washer. To demonstrate her displeasure and
unwillingness to do such a degrading task, she stomped to the tables in the
lounge and sat herself onto it. &quot;I'm not doing it anymore! I can't do this
all day! It wasn't my fault in the first place anyway!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;But my nail!&quot; Ruby wailed. &quot;Look, it's broken! And it's
all your fault!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;My fault?&quot; Takeshi pointed at his nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Daniel let out a sigh. Nobody will hear the end of this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Hours passed as the crew worked to clean the canteen. But no matter how
hard they cleaned, the place always seemed to grow back dirty. Was it how it
supposed to be, or was it their work that was lousy? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>It was eight thirty when they all decided to take a rest. Daniel, shoving
his shy side for once, decided to accompany Gillian at one of the tables where
she was having dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Chicken sandwich?&quot; Daniel raised his eyes up. &quot;Where did
you get that from?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Gillian gawked at him. Of course she was very aware of his intention to
chat with her. She appreciated it, but she as hell didn't appreciate his real
motive. &quot;Unlike the rest of the people here, I was smart enough to bring
some food.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Daniel laughed. The way she said it appeared funny, somehow. Well to him,
anyway. &quot;You're really cocky, you know that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Gillian shrugged. His slight insult wasn't meant to be one, so no offence
taken. &quot;Just say it. I'm a bitch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>He didn't deny. &quot;Well... at least you're not unreasonable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>They both glanced at Ruby, who was bugging Edison and whining about her
hunger. They smiled as though they shared a secret. &quot;You know, you're the
only one tolerable from the whole group. With Charlene that is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Daniel's gaze remain unchanged. &quot;Not really.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Interest sparked in Gillian's eyes. What did he mean by that?
&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>He smiled, mischief dancing in his eyes. It was then that she realized
that he had dark amber eyes, just like herself. &quot;Well, I have my bad
points too, you know? If you really know me, you'd think I'm intolerable
too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>She studied him. &quot;So, you're saying you're acting fake around
me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;No!&quot; Daniel retorted almost immediately, as if insulted. He
didn't realize she was going to take his words the wrong way. &quot;I mean...
Well, we haven't really gotten to know each other yet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Yeah, that was right. Still, she couldn't find any unlikable traits about
him. He was so nice, so kind, so affectionate, loyal, sweet, that typical boy
next door, only just much, much more adorable. Compared to Edison, oh my god,
that was like comparing a cockroach to a phoenix. Cockroach. Gillian laughed
mentally at that. Boy, that sure fit him! Annoying and useless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Her funny face made him stare at her. Apparently, she was smiling about
something. &quot;Look, I mean it. I'm not fake around you. This is the real me.
I swear. If you know me enough, you'll see this is the real me, along with my
bad points. I'm not lying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Gillian blinked. He seemed so uptight to make himself clear to her, which
made her slightly guilty. Boy, this was a problem that she would never get
herself out of. &quot;Hey...&quot; She put a halt to his jabbering that would
have been endless if she had not interrupted. &quot;Um, want some?&quot; she
offered her sandwich, not knowing how to respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Daniel gazed at her weirdly. But of course, not wanting to make her feel
bad, he accepted it and she broke half a piece of her egg sandwich.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Suddenly, Takeshi appeared out of no where in his sweaty attire resulted
from the endless scrubbing. &quot;You guys have food here?! And you didn't
share?!&quot; Takeshi looked outraged. &quot;Dan! I thought I was your good
pal!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Daniel rolled his eyes, hating the fact that his friend just interrupted
his time with Gillian. &quot;Get lost.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;So evil.&quot; Takeshi situated himself next to Daniel. &quot;Look
at you two. Eating from a sandwich. How romantic!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Disturbance instantly flickered itself onto Gillian's expression, perhaps
even horror. Time and time again, that same thought always made her brew in
guilt and disgust. Daniel seemed to notice her awkwardness and immediately
jabbed Takeshi's stomach with his elbow. &quot;Quit it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;It will be a scream from you next time,&quot; Daniel quietly
threatened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;I know I have like the perfect voice, but you don't have to hurt me
to hear it,&quot; Takeshi pouted, receiving a deadly glare. &quot;You're no
fun. I'm leaving.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Edison! Come back!&quot; Ruby's voice could be heard. Both Daniel
and Gillian turned to where it came from and saw that Edison was approaching
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>He shot Gillian a hazardous glare, one that could kill. &quot;Dan and
Gill. What are you two doing? Huh?&quot; He hissed, eyeing one half of the
sandwich in Gillian's hands to the other half in Daniel's, suspicion caroused.
However, Daniel mistaken that for jealousy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>&quot;Oh this? We're just sharing a sandwich. I'd like to give you some,
but you know, there is just so little to offer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'>Edison sat himself in Takeshi's seat. &quot;Oh man, you don't know what
you're digging yourself into.&quot; He said solemnly. &quot;I can't
believe--&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:15.0pt;
margin-left:0in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
