<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Chapter
Eleven: Confessions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
sucked in a breath and washed her face with cold water, as if it could defer
reality into a nightmare. But no such luck. All she saw in the mirror was flashbacks
of what just happened, and they were more real than anything else she had
experienced in her life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;How
could I be so stupid...&quot; she murmured, slightly dazed by the speed the
recurring of thoughts running through her head. Just yesterday, she had
basically announced that she liked Daniel at the canteen in open, and just a
moment ago, she accidentally confirmed and secured her position as his
girlfriend. Normal people would think she was absolutely in love with Daniel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>And
oh my God, how the thought stung.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>It
was such a bad idea digging this path. Why hadn't she backed down when she had
learned Daniel harbored some sort of romantic fondness towards her? No, she
just had to do the exact opposite. <span class=GramE>Stupid pride and
decisiveness.</span> If only she had seen this...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Could
things still be <span class=SpellE>rewindable</span>? Daniel's face had
contorted with nothingness but exhilaration when they won that game--how could
she explain to him? How could she disappoint him? Once he learned about her
real identity, hatred was his only definite route.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>She
bombed it. She had truly bombed it. <span class=GramE>To think that the reason
why she was even in this <span class=SpellE>pithole</span> in the first place
was to see if she should unite with her family or not.</span> But now even if
she wanted to, she couldn't anymore. Family reunion had never seemed so bleak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
wiped her face with a towel. She didn't know what to do next. Outside, Daniel
was probably still jumping in glee. Truthfully, she didn't want to leave the
bathroom. She didn't want to confront Daniel, or anybody else for that matter.
If only there was a way she could live in this bathroom and survive solely on
water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Pretty
barbaric but the thought of isolation soothed her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Suddenly,
the door banged open. Its abruptness was harsh and made Gillian jumped with
fret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;<span
class=GramE>Scheming</span> your next move?&quot; The edgy voice of Edison Chen
sneered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
class=GramE>No, not him again.</span> She had enough of his interrogations. Why
couldn't he give her a break? Couldn't he see that she was just as flustered as
he was? But wait, he probably thought she was snickering inside with total
mirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Did
you not see the sign outside or are you too blind? The men's room is next door
if you haven't noticed.&quot; Gillian coldly replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> slammed the door shut and grabbed the mop nearby
to lock it. For a moment, she wondered if he had thought about hitting her.
Surely, he must have been frustrated at her to that scope at one point... She
could say the same for herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Playing
the cold card, are you? Funny, you were anything but cold back out there.&quot;
<st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> crossed his arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Actually
he was wrong. She had been stiff ever since she made that final shot. Perhaps
he was too blinded by his own anger and Daniel's exuberance to have noticed
that. &quot;And since when have you <span class=GramE>became</span> the keen
observer?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Oh
shut your crap up! What did you think you were doing?&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
asked, finally hissing. &quot;I can't believe you would do that! He is your
damned fucking brother for crying out loud!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Don't
you think I know that?&quot; Gillian asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Apparently,
you need reminders!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> shouted.
&quot;To think that I trusted you enough to know what you're doing. But now, I
really, really doubt that. I can't believe I didn't fucking bust you out. What
the hell was I thinking all of those past weeks?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>His
insult slapped her. It was quite commendable how he kept his words about
protecting her secret all the while, trying to maintain loyalty to his friend.
Yet, that commendable trait threw daggers at <span class=GramE>her own</span>
dignity. Somehow, it made her feel like a bad person. &quot;I don't need your
reminders.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;You're
such a scum. I have never met such a conniving, evil bitch like you. I'm not
going to play your fucking games anymore. Daniel is my friend, and I won't
stand by to see him played like a fool. I'm going to tell--&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Do
you think I really want this to happen?!&quot; Gillian cut through him, her
patience had totally evaporated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> gazed at her, stunned. Obviously he hadn't
expected such a response. <span class=GramE>&quot;Oh, so what?</span> You
actually had another plan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Is
that all you think of me? A scheming bitch waiting to execute her plans at any
minute possible?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>He
scoffed. &quot;What else? I can't possibly think you're a princess?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;You
really think I would ruin my own brother?&quot; Gillian <span class=GramE>asked,</span>
her tone sharp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Why
wouldn't you? I mean, he is so fabulously rich! Just a scoop from his bag and
you can live the rest of your life worry-free! Your own father even abandoned
you! If you're not here for revenge, than what else could it be?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian's
eyes hardened. The mention of her father seemed to do the trick. &quot;How do you
know I was abandoned?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Come
on! Everybody knows what type of person your mother was!&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> shrilled. &quot;When she cheated on your father,
it was on the headlines for weeks! She totally brought a bad name to the Wu's.
It is no wonder that your own father didn't want you anymore.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Her
fists curled as a whip of revulsion spanked her mind. No, she did not know any
of this, but this guy, how could he know so much? <span class=GramE>Things that
she didn't even know?</span> Did he <span class=GramE>made</span> all of that
trash up? &quot;You're lying!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;I
don't have the time to fucking lie to you. Go ask Daniel if you'd like. I mean,
he is so in love with you that he'd even tell you where his good spots are so
you could<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>please the shit out of
him--&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>SLAP!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s face snapped to the side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;You
fucking bastard,&quot; seethed an angry Gillian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>The
hurt in her eyes was so evident that it baffled him. His words were a little
bit out of hand, but a person like her shouldn't get so offended by such
things. Unless...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;What
have I ever done to you?&quot; she asked, her eyes tearing with wetness. <st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> was so stunned by her faltering of strength. She
had sounded and acted so tough that he never considered a girly side of her
possible, but now, she resembled a little girl, lost and hurt. &quot;Why do you
always insult me? What did I do to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>'s mouth remained inadvertent agape. The way she
was responding was obviously too perplex for him to grasp. They were just
words! Why was she so overworked about them? And it wasn't like she was an
innocent girl. His &quot;insults&quot; did hold some truth in them. <span
class=GramE>So why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Ever
since I met you, you never cease to make my life a fucking hell. You think I
like pulling a bitchy face whenever I confront you?&quot; Gillian's voice was
shaky with <span class=SpellE>overwhealmed</span> emotions. &quot;You think I
like being called a manipulative bitch every single time? What do you think I
am? I have feelings too, you know! I'm a human being. Not a witch!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>He
stood still in his posture, but he couldn't utter a word. It was true. A
manipulative bitch was all he ever saw in her and he never stopped twice to
think about it. Now, the way she was breaking down brought a whole new
impression. She, too, was a girl... in need of protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;I'm
not here to ruin my brother, to inherit his riches, or whatever.&quot; She
continued, tone still croaking. But there was no sight of tears running down
her cheeks. They were all <span class=GramE>glittering</span> in her eyes. Even
when she seemed like a girl, she was a stubborn one. &quot;I just wanted to
learn more about him. I want to be myself when I'm around with him. If he knew
I was the sister that was abandoned, would he still treat me as one? I mean,
you said it, I was abandoned. Why would they take me back after all of those
years? I was probably a shame to them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Gillian
turned to face him directly in the eyes. He could see everything in there. The
sincerity, the insecurity, fear, anger, all ebbed in those dark brown <span
class=SpellE>pupiles</span>. For once, guilt rambled every part of his body.
&quot;If I just came up to him and said I was his sister, how would he react?
He'd think I have some interior motives. He wouldn't believe me. Even if he
did, he probably won't like me. Who knows what he had heard about me? So why
would I take the risk of being rejected again when I can be accepted as an
entirely new person?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><st1:place
w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> could feel his hate for her faltering, but his
pride wasn't willing to let that go easily. &quot;You think I believe in that
crap?&quot; His mouth spoke without his consent. &quot;I mean, if that was
true, you wouldn't deliberately try to seduce--&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Seduce?
Is still goes back to that huh? I'm just a seductive, manipulative, evil bitch
to you no matter what, is that right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Well--&quot;
he stopped, not knowing what to say to that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Why
am I even talking to you? No matter what I say, you won't believe me.&quot; Gillian
said flatly. Her emotional side disappeared and what surfaced again was her
usual demeanor. The transformation was so brief that <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place>
wouldn't believe she was the same person if he hadn't witnessed her breakdown.
&quot;All you want to hear is, I’m Daniel’s sister and I came here to purposely
ruin him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>CLUMP.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Edison
and Gillian immediately looked towards the door. Someone's purse lay on the
ground, and undeniably, the look on the shocked Ruby's face told that she had
heard something.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Horror
climbed onto Gillian's expression. How could this be? It was a Thursday evening
and no way could Ruby be here now unless she had extra classes--<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Oh
<span class=GramE>my gosh</span>!&quot; Ruby finally recovered from her initial
shock and exclaimed. &quot;I knew it! There was something fishy about you all
along! I so knew it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>&quot;Rubes,
keep it down!&quot; <st1:place w:st="on">Edison</st1:place> hushed, fearing
that the others might hear. They were just outside in the basketball court, and
